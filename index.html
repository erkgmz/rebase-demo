  <h1>Rebase Demo</h1>
  <p>This is how you rebase</p>
  master and testing branch

  STEPS:
    - From branch run `git rebase master` (rebase will stop if there are any conflicts)
    - Then run `git checkout master` (or autos-development in our case)
    - From master run `git merge branchName`

  Other things to look at:
    If your branch ever diverges from origin/master
    You can look into doing
    `git pull --rebase`
    Which will pull and merge all the commits from origin/master and rebase your commits to master
  
  Step 4: 
    Now we rebase. From your master branch run the following:
      - `git checkout branchName`
      - `git rebase master` (moves your commit history to the base of master)
      - `git checkout master`
      - `git merge branchName`

  Voila! It's that easy.
