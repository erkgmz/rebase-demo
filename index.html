  <h1>Rebase Demo</h1>
  <p>This is how you rebase</p>

  <p>Step 1:</p>
    Switch to autos-development and pull all of your changes before you make a new branch: 
      - `git fetch` (read here for more info on fetch https://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/what-is-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch)
      - `git pull`

  <p>Step 2:</p>
    Now that autos-development is up-to-date, you will need to create a branch to do your work in:
      - `git checkout -b new-branch`
      - code code code...

  <p>Step 3:</p>
    Once work is complete, add and commit. It's best practice to have the latest version of master on your local before rebasing so we'll do a final fetch/pull:
      - `git add -A && git commit -m 'I did x on y and fixed z as well'` (that's a terrible commit message btw)
      - `git checkout master`
      - Repeat Step 1

  <p>Step 4:</p>
    Now we rebase. From your master branch run the following:
      - `git checkout branchName`
      - `git rebase master` (moves your commit history to the base of master)
      - `git checkout master`
      - `git merge branchName`

  <p>Step :</p>
    After all of that is complete and you resolved and conflicts you had, you are ready to push. 
    With rebase, we will be pushing directly from the autos-development branch:
      - `git push`


  Here are a few tips for you to look into so you're ready for the day when yopu get stuck:
  - `git pull --rebase` - Helpful if the commits in you local master have diverged from origin/master. Should be a rare since we normally do work in a branch. 
  - `git rebase --continue` - Run this after you've resolved any merge conflicts you've had with rebase
  - `git rebase --abort` - Abort the rebase and return to the original state
  - Ask for help (ofcourse)
